For most of my career, I have worked as a one-person dev team. I was essentially a full stack developer before I had even heard of the title!

It wasn't until relatively recently that I started to work in dev teams of 2 or more people. In fact, our dev team is still quite small at just 6 people (although we plan to increase this to about 8 very soon).

So one of the challenges I faced was adapting to working in teams. This is normally not an issue for most devs/engineers because they would start out in a team. Having worked on big projects both on my own and in a team, I have been able to experience both sides of coin. There are naturally pros and cons of both and I am going to discuss these below.

  <p>We have recently been migrating our compliance platform from .NET 4.7 to .NET Core 3.</p>
<p>The existing code uses Autofac to manage inversion of control and we wanted to stick with it for now, instead of using the built-in DI middleware that comes packaged with .NET Core 3.</p>
<p>Part of the Autofac container building process involves scanning assemblies within the bin folder for plugins. The existing code contained a section that looked something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> assemblyNames = Directory.EnumerateFiles
(
    binPath,
    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;*.dll&#34;</span>,
    SearchOption.AllDirectories
);

assemblies.AddRange
(
	assemblyNames.Select(Assembly.LoadFrom)
);
</code></pre></div><p>This code had been working fine for the past 2 years, so when I ran the .NET Core 3 version and received the following exception, it stumped me for a while:</p>
<pre><code>System.BadImageFormatException: 'Bad IL format.'
</code></pre><p>At first I thought I might have some old DLLs left over from the .NET 4.7 build, so I deleted all bin and obj folders then tried again - to no avail. A quick Google search lead me to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51080797/bad-il-format-strange-net-error">Stack Overflow question</a>. It suggests three possible fixes:</p>
<ol>
<li>If your application uses 32-bit components, make sure that it always runs as a 32-bit application.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are not using a component that was created with a different version of the .NET Framework.</li>
<li>Make sure that the file image is a valid managed assembly or module.</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried changing the platform target on the .NET Core 3 project from <strong>AnyCPU</strong> to 32-bit and then 64-bit, but both made no difference. I was confident that points 2 and 3 were covered because I had updated all NuGet packages and the code as only scanning for .dll files.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was creating a new Git branch and then converting the project to .NET Core 2.2 (the latest version before 3.0). I cleaned the bin folders and ran the project - it worked!</p>
<p>So I was able to determine that it was a problem specific to .NET Core 3. I took a closer look at the generated bin folder for .NET Core 3 and noticed one difference from the other framework versions - a folder named <strong>runtimes</strong>.</p>
<p>If you notice in the code snippet above, I set the searchOption parameter to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">SearchOption.AllDirectories
</code></pre></div><p>Within the runtimes folder there are a cocktail of DLLs built for x86 and x64 architectures and debugging the above code confirmed that it was these DLLs (which I didn&rsquo;t need to scan anyway) that were causing the problem.</p>
<p>I looked into this and discovered that applications created in .NET Core can be published in two different modes; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/">self-contained and runtime-dependent</a>. By default, it seems they are published as self-contained (which creates the runtimes folder). I didn&rsquo;t want to change this behaviour, so I fixed it by simply changing the searchOptions parameter to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly
</code></pre></div><p>This ensures that only the DLLs contained in the bin folder (<strong>not</strong> sub folders) are scanned.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started working on a greenfield project to replace an existing platform we have. When starting new projects in recent years I&amp;rsquo;ve applied more of a pure DDD (Domain Driven Design) architectural approach. One of the fundamental ideas within DDD is the ValueObject, a term coined by Martin Fowler. There is a great article about implementing value objects that you should check out if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with them.</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until relatively recently that I started to work in dev teams of 2 or more people. In fact, our dev team is still quite small at just 6 people (although we plan to increase this to about 8 very soon).</description>

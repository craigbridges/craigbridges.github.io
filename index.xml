      <description>For this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore some of the ways that have helped me and may help you become more a productive dev. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about practices such as Agile, Scrum or DevOps because those are focussed on teams. In this post I want to focus on the individual developer and how they can improve their own productivity.
The Developer Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious, but often overlooked (and most important) area, the developer.</description>

      <title>Useful Value Objects</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started working on a greenfield project to replace an existing platform we have. When starting new projects in recent years I&amp;rsquo;ve applied more of a pure DDD (Domain Driven Design) architectural approach. One of the fundamental ideas within DDD is the ValueObject, a term coined by Martin Fowler. There is a great article about implementing value objects that you should check out if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with them.</description>

      <description>For most of my career, I have worked as a one-person dev team. I was essentially a full stack developer before I had even heard of the title!
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until relatively recently that I started to work in dev teams of 2 or more people. In fact, our dev team is still quite small at just 6 people (although we plan to increase this to about 8 very soon).</description>

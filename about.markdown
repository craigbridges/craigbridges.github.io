My name is Craig Bridges. I live in South West England and I'm a software engineer at Code Change.

My preferred programming language is C#. I'm interested in software architecture, machine learning and IoT.

I'm also a father, middle-distance runner, photographer and philosopher. I have public collection with thousands of photos I have taken over the years on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bridgethegap/albums).

## Background
I started learning to code in VB6 back in 2002 when I was at sixth form and built various applications in my spare time. At the time, I also became a part time classroom teaching assistance for the lower year computing students. I then studied BSc Hons Computing part time at University of the West of England (UWE) and graduated in 2010 with first-class honours.

While studying at university, I worked at Schools Mailing as an IT Consultant, but my job mostly revolved around software development. Creating and maintaining VB6, VBA and classic ASP based applications. One of the highlights from this job was creating a fully integrated email marketing desktop software package which was used for distributing hundreds of thousands of emails on behalf of customers.

After nearly 7 years at Schools Mailing, I decided it was time for a career break, so I resigned and took a career gap year, travelling around Mexico and South America. While travelling, I was working freelance for my current boss. I worked on various projects, including an e-commerce platform built in .NET MVC.

Since 2012, I have been working full time for Code Change as the lead software engineer. I have since worked on various projects, including e-commerce, e-learning, asset and probate management and more recently compliant insurance and finance within the automotive industry.
